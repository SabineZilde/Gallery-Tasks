                <h3>About Greg Dunn</h3>

                <h5>How I began making brain and neuroscience art</h5>

                <p> I began painting brain and neuroscience art and in grad school at the University of Pennsylvania. My
                    love for the brain and the beautiful forms of neurons fit harmoniously into my love for Asian art. I
                    began exploring art of the brain and neurons through ink paintings and scrolls, painting commissions
                    for universities and individuals. Over time, I gradually began using gold in my art.</p>

                <p>After years of experimentation with gold leaf, I invented a hyper detailed process called reflective
                    microetching with my collaborator Dr. Brian Edwards. This style of art uses reflected light to
                    create animated scenes on a seemingly flat piece of art on the wall.</p>

                <h5> Who most often purchases brain art?</h5>

                <p>I routinely provide artwork for neurosurgery, neurology, neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry
                    departments, clinics, and offices. My work very often appeals to anybody with an interest in the
                    beauty and mystery of the brain and mind. I provide prints, ink paintings, microetchings, gold leaf
                    works, scrolls, murals, and large installations. Many use my art as a reference in brain related
                    fields due to itâ€™s scientific accuracy and ability to engage the public in the complex themes of the
                    brain.
